Hey, my name is Gustavo Reis Bauer. I am a software engineer from Brazil, with a few years of experience on the most diverse stuff one can imagine.

Currently, I work at a large scale open source software company called [Rocket.Chat](https://www.rocket.chat/), as a full-stack engineer, I've worked with Golang and Typescript mostly.

My current passion is about compilers and compiler engineering, I've been reading everything I can find about it in the past few months.
